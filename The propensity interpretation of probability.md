Probability is a physical **propensity** (tendency) of a system to yield a certain outcome. Propensity produces outcomes with a certain limiting relative frequency (similar to the one mentioned in the [[The frequency interpretation of probability|frequentist interpretation]]). However, propensity allows for single-case propensities.

**Problems**:
- Just because you defined propensity, does not mean it exists.
- For it to control the frequency of occurrences, it needs to solve the frequentist problems.
- Long run propensity tests should abide by the law of big numbers, but that demands some mathematical properties from propensity (which is ill-defined)
- Using [[Bayes' theorem]], we can reverse a conditional probability ($P(A|B)=$$P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)$). However, propensity should determine the outcome, the outcome determining propensity shouldn't make sense.
