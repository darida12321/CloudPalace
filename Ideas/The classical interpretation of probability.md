This interpretation relies on the **Principle of Indifference**. To get the possibility of an event, reduce it to equally possible cases and count them up.

**Bertrand's paradoxes**: Bertrand created some situations where this logic breaks down.
Imagine a factory making cubes, whose side lengths are between 0 and 1. Based on the principle of indifference, thee expected side length is 1/2, so the expected face area is 1/4. However, the face are is also between 0 and 1, so the expected face are should be 1/2.

**Problems**:
- The principle of indifference is extracting information from ignorance.
