Similar to [[Independent events|independent events]]. A [[Continuous random variable|continuous random variable]] can be **independent** from a [[Random event|random event]], or another [[Continuous random variable|continuous random variable]].

Independence from an [[Random event|event]]:  $P(X\in A\land Y\in B)=P(X\in A)P(Y\in B)$
Independence from a [[Continuous random variable|continuous random variable]]: $f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$

We can describe this via [[Conditional probability density function|conditional PDFs]]: $f_{X|Y}(x|y)=f_X(x)$

Of course, these definitions can be extended to multiple variables and events. If a set of 3 or more events are independent, it doesn't imply that any two are independent and vice versa.
