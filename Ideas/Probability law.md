A **probability law** is a [[Functions|function]] that maps an [[Random event|event]] $A$ to a **probability** $P(A)$.
It must follow [[Kolmogorov’s axiomatization|Kolmogorov's axioms]]

##### Discrete probability law: 
For finite [[Sample space|sample spaces]], the **probability**of an [[Random event|event]] is the sum of the probabilities of its elements. $P(\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\})=P(\{s_1\})+P(\{s_2\})+\dots+P(\{s_n\})$
