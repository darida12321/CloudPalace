The [[Random event|events]], $A_1,A_2\dots A_n$ are **independent** iff:
$$P(\bigcap_{i\in S}A_i)=\prod_{i\in S} P(A_i)$$

We can also describe this via [[Conditional probability|conditional probability]]: $P(A|B)=P(A)$.
If a set of 3 events are independent, it doesn't imply that any two are independent and vice versa.
