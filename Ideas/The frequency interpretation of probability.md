The **frequency interpretation** claims that the probability of an [[Probabilistic events|event]] $A$ in a finite reference class $B$ is the relative frequency of the occurrences of $A$ in $B$.

This is similar to the [[The classical interpretation of probability|classical interpretation]], but instead of counting possible occurrences, we count actual outcomes.

**Problems**: 
- Real-world results can be misleading (a coin can land head 10 times in a row)
- A fair coin tossed 1000 will most likely not land heads exactly 500 times.
- A coin that was never tossed lacks a probability for heads.
- A single selected radon atom decays only once, so instead of an exponential decay, we get that it decays at the time it actually does with 100% probability.
- Irrational-valued probabilities are not possible (fractions are always rational)
- Different definitions of a reference class yield different results.

Some of these problems are solved with **infinite frequentism**, which states that we need an infinite amount of experiments to converge to the true probability. However, new problems are introduced by this.

**Problem**:
- We can't actually repeat something an infinite amount of times.
- Infinite sequences can be reordered and made to approach a different sum.
