In probabilistic events, the [[Sample spaces|sample space]] often has the structure of sequential events. In this case, thinking of it as a [[Tree graph|tree graph]] can help simplify the model.

> [!example]-
> In this experiment we throw a dice. If it lands on a 6, we throw a second time.

> We could think of the sample space as a set containing 12 elements. However, it is easier to model this as a tree graph where the root has 6 branches, and the 6th branch has 6 child nodes.
