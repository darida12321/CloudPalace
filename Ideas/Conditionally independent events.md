The [[Random event|events]], $A_1,A_2\dots A_n$ are **conditionally independent** iff:
$$P(\bigcap_{i\in S}A_i|C)=\prod_{i\in S} P(A_i|C)$$
This can be described via [[Conditional probability|conditional probability]]: $P(A_1|A_2\cap C)=P(A_1|C)$
Conditional independence doesn't imply [[Independent events|independence]], and vice-versa.
