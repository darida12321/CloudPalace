In an experiment that is best described [[Sequential description of sample space|sequentially]], if we know the [[Conditional probability|conditional probability]] of each step, we can calculate the probability of a sequence of events by:
$$P(\cap_{i=1}^nA_i)=P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)P(A_3|A_1\cap A_2)\dots P(A_n|\cap_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i)$$
