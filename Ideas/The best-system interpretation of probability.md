**Laws of nature** are the best systematization of the universe. They strive for:
- **Simplicity**: How simple the theory is.
- **Strength**: How confidently it predicts things.
- **Fit**: How probable the history of the universe is according to the theory.

In this interpretation, **probability** is just a **law of nature**. It doesn't have to exist, but it's a useful theory for humans.

**Problems**:
- Simplicity, strength and fit are all ill-defined.
