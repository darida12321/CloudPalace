Similar to [[Independent events|independent events]]. A [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]] can be **independent** from a [[Random event|random event]], or another [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]].

Independence from an [[Random event|event]]:  $P(\{X=x\}\cap A)=P(X=x)P(A)=p_X(x)P(A)$
Independence from a [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]]: $p_{X,Y}(x,y)=p_X(x)p_Y(y)$

We can describe this via [[Conditional probability mass function|conditional PMFs]]: $p_{X|Y}(x|y)=p_X(x)$

Of course, these definitions can be extended to multiple variables and events. If a set of 3 or more events are independent, it doesn't imply that any two are independent and vice versa.
