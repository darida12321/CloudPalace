The joint [[Probability mass function|probability mass function]] of [[Random variable|random variables]] $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ is:
$$p_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)=P(X=x,Y=y,Z=z)$$

We can get back the [[Probability mass function|PMFs]] of smaller joint functions by $p_{X,Y}(x,y)=\sum_zp_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)$
We refer to $p_X$, $p_Y$ and $p_Z$ as the **marginal PMFs**.
