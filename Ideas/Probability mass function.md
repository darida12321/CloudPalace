The **probability mass function** (PMF) for a [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]] $X$ is denoted $p_X$. It's value is $p_X(x)=P(\{X=x\})$, or with simplified notation: $P(X=x)$.

The sum of all probabilities should be 1. This is the **normalization property**. 
$$\sum_x p_X(x)=1$$
