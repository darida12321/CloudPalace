A [[Continuous random variable|continuous random variable]], which is a good approximation of a sum of [[Independent discrete random variable|independent]] and identically distributed [[Random variable|random variables]] due to the [[Central limit theorem|central limit theorem]]. It's defined by parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$, which are the 
$$f_X(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}$$
The [[Expectation|mean]] is $\mu$, and the [[Variance|variance]] is $\sigma^2$.
A special case of this is the [[Standard normal random variable|standard normal random variable]], where $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$.
