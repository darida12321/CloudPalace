The **evidential interpretation** claims that the [[The logical interpretation of probability|logical interpretation]] is flawed. There are probabilities that were reached in a non-logical way. ("The sun will probably rise tomorrow")

This interpretation claims that probability is not about truth value or frequency, but about **evidence**. How much an evidence helps/hinders a hypothesis.

**Problems**:
- There is no universal description of "evidence", thus we have no way of figuring out what the probability of something is.
