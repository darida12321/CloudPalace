The **expected value** (Also called **expectation** or **mean**) of a [[Random variable|random variable]] $X$ with [[Probability mass function|PMF]] $p_X(x)$ is the weighted average of all outcomes.
$$E[X]=\sum_xxp_X(x)$$

If two [[Random variable|random variables]] are [[Independent random variable|independent]], then $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$. In fact, if we take  [[Functions|functions]] $f$ and $g$, we get $E[f(X)g(Y)]=E[f(X)]E[g(Y)]$
