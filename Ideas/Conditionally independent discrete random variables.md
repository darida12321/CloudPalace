Similar to [[Conditionally independent events|conditionally independent events]], some number of [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variables]] are independent iff:
$$P_{X,Y,Z|A}(x,y,z)=p_{X|A}(x)p_{Y|A}(y)p_{Z|A}(z)$$

We can describe this via [[Conditional probability mass function|conditional PMFs]]: $p_{X|Y,A}(x|y)=p_{X|A}(x)$

This can be extended to any number of variables.
Conditional independence doesn't imply [[Independent discrete random variable|independence]], and vice-versa.
