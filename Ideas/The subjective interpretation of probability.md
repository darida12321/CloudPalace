The **subjective interpretation** claims that probability is the degree of belief. In more practical terms, your belief in an event $E$ is $p$ iff you would spend $p$ money on a gamble that pays you 1 money if $E$ happens, and 0 if it doesn't.

The [[Dutch book theorem]] argues that betting follows [[Kolmogorov’s axiomatization|Kolmogorov's axioms]].

It should be noted that not all beliefs are equal. We need an agent to be rational. Under **Orthodox Bayesianism**, which requires agents to follow [[Kolmogorov’s axiomatization|Kolmogorov's axioms]], and to take evidence into account. There is also **Objective Bayesianism**, which imposes a plethora of additional conditions.

This is the most commonly accepted approach, due to the advances in [[Epistemology|epistemology]].


##### Utility approach
In addition to betting, we can also say that each agent assign a utility $u(A)$ to each even $A$. An event has probability 1/2 if the agent prefers $A$ to $B$, but feels indifferent towards the bets "$A$ if $N$, $B$ if not" and "$B$ if $N$, $A$ if not".

If the agent is indifferent between "$A$" and "$B$ if $X$, $C$ otherwise", it's belief in $X$ is:
$$P(X)=\frac{u(A)-u(C)}{u(B)-u(C)}$$

This line of thinking follows the probability axioms, and it enhances the betting analysis.

**Problems**: 
- We don't know if preferences and beliefs really are interlinked. Example: Buddhist monk that has beliefs about the world, but no preferences.
- We can't precisely quantify utility, weakening ascertainability.
